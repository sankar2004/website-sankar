        A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching
         of students under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education, which is sometimes compulsory.<br>
         [2] In these systems, students progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed
          in the Regional terms section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teena<br>
          gers who have completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university.
        In addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary (elementary<br>
         in the U.S.) and secondary (middle school in the U.S.) education. Kindergarten or preschool provide some schooling to very 
         young children (typically ages 3â€“5). University, vocational school, college or seminary may be available after secondary <br>
         school. A school may be dedicated to one particular field, such as a school of economics or dance. Alternative schools 
         may provide nontraditional curriculum and methods. Non-government schools, also known as private schools,[3] may be required<br>
          when the government does not supply adequate or specific educational needs. Other private schools can also be religious, 
          such as Christian schools, gurukula (Hindu schools), madrasa (Arabic schools), hawzas (Shi'i Muslim schools), yeshivas <br>
          (Jewish schools), and others; or schools that have a higher standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements. 
          Schools for adults include institutions of corporate training, military education and training and business schools.<br>
